Our Mission at Resolv360
We are a diverse team of experienced professionals and apprentices from renowned institutes across the country, operating fully remotely for over a year. United by a shared vision, we are bootstrapped and committed to building a platform that supports apprentices, flex workers, and experienced mentors.
You might wonder if AI is part of our roadmap—absolutely! We are actively integrating AI to create innovative societal products and services. As we expand our expertise in AI, we’re also cultivating a robust network of mentors in Product, Design, Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Data, AI, Security, and more.
Our focus is on developing a strong framework that will enable us to scale and grow multiple products and projects at an accelerated pace. At our core, we believe in building sustainable business models that endure.
